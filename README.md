I created this brief quiz to present my javascript knowledge and its various functions.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

To begin with, i created all the necessary Div class and headings in my html page.

I used button createElement functions to create button in my javascript code. 

I used setInterval function to create timer and clear interval to stop the timer when the quiz is over.

i used a remove element to remove buttons as we proceed with the quiz.
