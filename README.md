I created this brief quiz to present my javascript knowledge and its various functions.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

To begin with, i created all the necessary Div class and headings in my html page.

I used button createElement functions to create button in my javascript code. 

I used setInterval function to create timer and clear interval to stop the timer when the quiz is over.

i used a remove element to remove buttons as we proceed with the quiz and create new buttons simaltaneoulsy. 

I called a simple wrong and correct function to subtract time and add score at the end.

Each time you select an answer either correct or wrong function is initiated to add score or reduce time from the quiz. 

I called postquiz function to put my initials and score to local storage so i can recall it later at the score page.
